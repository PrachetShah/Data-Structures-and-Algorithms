## When to use which Sorting Method
* Insertion Sort to be used with (small input or mostly sorted input)
* Bubble Sort is never used generally because it is not efficient
* Selection Sort is also used
* Merge Sort is really good because of D&C, if worried about Worst Case then use Merge Sort, dont use it if you have space complexity in mind, it has Space of O(n)
* Quick Sort is same as Merge Sort in avg Time Complexity and better in Space Complexity.It just has some 
* Heap Sort is good time and space wise but Quick Sort wins over it. Heap Sort Best Resource: https://brilliant.org/wiki/heap-sort/
